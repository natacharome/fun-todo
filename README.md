# Fun todo app in vanilla JS

I wanted to create a fun todo app, not like the other ones. I have a intern under my responsability that learn web developement and I wanted to gave him a fun exercice. So what's best than to make it myself before gaving it to him ?

Design made by myself in Figma.

## Future features to develop

- Implement localstorage
- Implement list display
- Implement todo list
- Implement task form
- Implement (maybe) several languages (fr/en)
